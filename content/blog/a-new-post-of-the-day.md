Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink"[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1) in [New Bern, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bern,_North_Carolina "New Bern, North Carolina"), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold.

It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, "Pepsi" because it was advertised to relieve [dyspepsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia "Dyspepsia")[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-TompkinsBaughman1994-2)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-Donovan2013-3) (today more commonly known as [indigestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigestion "Indigestion") or an upset stomach) and "Cola" referring to the [cola flavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola "Cola").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-Donovan2013-3) Some have also suggested that "Pepsi" may have been a reference to the drink aiding digestion like the digestive enzyme [pepsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin "Pepsin"),[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-Stoddard2011-4)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-Donovan2013-3) but pepsin itself was never used as an ingredient to Pepsi-Cola.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1)

The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1) Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1)

The original stylized Pepsi-Cola wordmark used from 1898 until 1905.

In 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer [Barney Oldfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Oldfield "Barney Oldfield") was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi-Cola, describing it as "A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race." The advertising theme "Delicious and Healthful" was then used over the next two decades.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-5)

In 1923, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcyâ€”in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-store-1) Megargel was unsuccessful in efforts to find funding to revive the brand and soon Pepsi's assets were purchased by [Charles Guth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Guth "Charles Guth"), the president of [Loft, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loft,_Inc. "Loft, Inc.") Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola "Coca-Cola") at his stores' fountains after [the Coca-Cola Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company "The Coca-Cola Company") refused to give him additional discounts on syrup. Guth then had Loft's chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-6)

On three occasions between 1922 and 1933, the Coca-Cola Company was offered the opportunity to purchase the Pepsi-Cola company, and it declined on each occasion.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi#cite_note-7)
